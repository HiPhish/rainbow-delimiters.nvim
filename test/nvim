# A wrapper around Neovim which makes the editor launch in the isolated
# environment.  This wrapper is meant for interactive use so the programmer can
# poke around in a live Neovim process which is not affected by the
# programmer's own configuration.

# Set custom XDG base directory paths to isolate the test Neovim from the
# user's own configuration and data files.
