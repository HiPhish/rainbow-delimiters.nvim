INTRODUCTION                                             *rb-delimiters-intro*

This plugin provides alternating highlighting for delimiters in Neovim, also
known as "rainbow parentheses".  Thanks to the built-in |treesitter| support
we are not limited to just parentheses.  We can match any part of the document
tree, such as HTML tags or `do` / `end` pairs in Lua.  We can define new
patterns for existing languages, add support for new languages and even change
the strategy used for highlighting.


==============================================================================
SETUP AND CONFIGURATION                                  *rb-delimiters-setup*

Install Rainbow-Delimiters like any other Neovim plugin.  You also need a
Tree-sitter parser for each language to want to support.

                                                        *g:rainbow_delimiters*
Configuration is done through the variable `g:rainbow_delimiters`.  It is a
dictionary which can be defined both in Vim script and in Lua.  The following
keys are recognized:

`strategy`
  How to apply highlighting.  The empty string is the key for the default
  strategy. See |rb-delimiters-strategy| for more information about strategies
  and the possible values.

`query`
  Dictionary mapping Tree-sitter language names to queries.  The empty string
  is the key for the default query.  See |rb-delimiters-query| for more
  information about queries.

`priority`
  Dictionary mapping Tree-sitter language names to highlight priority values.
  The empty string is the key for the default priority.  See
  |vim.highlight.priorities| and |treesitter-highlight-priority| for more
  information on priorities.

`highlight`
  List of names of the highlight groups to use for highlighting, for more
  information see |rb-delimiters-colors|.

`whitelist`
  List of Tree-sitter languages for which to enabled rainbow delimiters.
  Rainbow delimiters will be disabled for all other languages.

`blacklist`
  List of Tree-sitter languages for which to disabled rainbow delimiters.
  Rainbow delimiters will be enabled for all other languages.

`condition`
  Function which receives the current buffer number and returns a boolean; can
  be used to dynamically decide whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
  rainbow delimiters for a given buffer.  You could for example use this
  predicate to disable rainbow delimiters for large files.

  Superceeded by the blacklist, but superceedes the whitelist.  This means if
  the file type is blacklisted the condtion is ignored, but if the file type
  is whitelisted or not blacklisted the condition will be evaluated and
  honoured.

`log`
  Settings for logging information.  This is a dictionary which contains
  further settings.  See |rb-delimiters-logging| for details.

If neither the white- nor the blacklist are set rainbow delimiters will be
enabled for all languages. If both lists are set it is undefined which will
take precedence.


Here is an example configuration:
>vim
    let g:rainbow_delimiters = {
        \ 'strategy': {
            \ '': 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.global',
            \ 'vim': 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.local',
        \ },
        \ 'query': {
            \ '': 'rainbow-delimiters',
            \ 'lua': 'rainbow-blocks',
        \ },
        \ 'priority': {
            \ '': 110,
            \ 'lua': 210,
        \ },
        \ 'highlight': [
            \ 'RainbowDelimiterRed',
            \ 'RainbowDelimiterYellow',
            \ 'RainbowDelimiterBlue',
            \ 'RainbowDelimiterOrange',
            \ 'RainbowDelimiterGreen',
            \ 'RainbowDelimiterViolet',
            \ 'RainbowDelimiterCyan',
        \ ],
        \ 'blacklist': ['c', 'cpp'],
    \ }
<

Alternatively, the same configuration in Lua:
>lua
    -- This module contains a number of default definitions
    local rainbow_delimiters = require 'rainbow-delimiters'

    ---@type rainbow_delimiters.config
    vim.g.rainbow_delimiters = {
        strategy = {
            [''] = 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.global',
            commonlisp = 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.local',
        },
        query = {
            [''] = 'rainbow-delimiters',
            lua = 'rainbow-blocks',
        },
        priority = {
            [''] = 110,
            lua = 210,
        },
        highlight = {
            'RainbowDelimiterRed',
            'RainbowDelimiterYellow',
            'RainbowDelimiterBlue',
            'RainbowDelimiterOrange',
            'RainbowDelimiterGreen',
            'RainbowDelimiterViolet',
            'RainbowDelimiterCyan',
        },
        blacklist = {'c', 'cpp'},
    }
<

                                                    *rainbow-delimiters.setup*
'rainbow-delimiters.setup'.setup({config})

Some people prefer to call a Lua `setup` function, so a setup function is
available as part of a Lua module.
>lua
    require 'rainbow-delimiters.setup'.setup {
        strategy = {
            [''] = 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.global',
            commonlisp = 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.local',
        },
        query = {
            [''] = 'rainbow-delimiters',
            latex = 'rainbow-blocks',
        },
        highlight = {
            'RainbowDelimiterRed',
            'RainbowDelimiterYellow',
            'RainbowDelimiterBlue',
            'RainbowDelimiterOrange',
            'RainbowDelimiterGreen',
            'RainbowDelimiterViolet',
            'RainbowDelimiterCyan',
        },
        blacklist = {'c', 'cpp'},
    }
<
The keys are exactly the same as for |g:rainbow_delimiters|.  In fact, this
function does the same as setting the variable directly.

As an aside, this is a bad practice carried over from a time when Lua support
in Neovim still had issues with Vim script interoperability, but it has
persisted through cargo-culting.  You are better off not using this function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGHLIGHT COLORS                                        *rb-delimiters-colors*

The `highlight` setting controls which highlight group to apply.  It is a list
of any number of highlight group names as strings.  The default values are in
this order:

- `RainbowDelimiterRed`
- `RainbowDelimiterYellow`
- `RainbowDelimiterBlue`
- `RainbowDelimiterOrange`
- `RainbowDelimiterGreen`
- `RainbowDelimiterViolet`
- `RainbowDelimiterCyan`

These are non-standard highlight groups and I have tried to find reasonable
default values for most uses.  Nevertheless, you probably want to redefine
them for your colour scheme or link them to some existing group.

The colors are intentionally not in the order of the rainbow to help make the
contrast between adjacent delimiters more noticeable.  Re-order the groups in
your settings if you prefer a different order.

Example highlight group definitions:
>vim
    " Link to an existing highlight group
    highlight link RainbowDelimiterRed WarningMsg

    " Define the highlight from scratch
    highlight RainbowDelimiterOrange  guifg=#d65d0e ctermfg=White
<
You will probably want to have different colours per theme.  Since most themes
will lack definitions for the above groups you will need to hook in somehow.
A simple solution is to use an autocommand.
>vim
    au ColorSchemePre MyTheme highlight link RainbowDelimiter MyThemeRed
    au ColorSchemePre MyTheme highlight link RainbowDelimiter MyThemeYellow
    " and so on...
<


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGIES                                            *rb-delimiters-strategy*

A strategy defines how to perform the highlighting of delimiters.  For
example, the included global strategy highlights every delimiter in a buffer
and updates the highlights when the document tree changes.  On the other hand,
the included local strategy highlights only the sub-tree of the document which
contains the cursor and is updated whenever the cursor moves.

The strategy is set globally with per-language overrides.  The empty string is
the key for the default strategy used by all languages which do not have their
own setting.  The setting value is of one of the following types:

    • String path to a Lua module which is a strategy
    • A dictionary according to |rb-delimiters-custom-strategy|
    • A function which returns a string or a strategy

A function can be used to defer the decision to a later point in time.  It has
the following signature:

    Parameters: ~
      • {bufnr}  Number of the buffer to highlight

    Return: ~
      Either a string, a strategy or `nil` (or |v:null|).  If `nil`, rainbow
      delimiters will be disabled for that buffer.

NOTE
Functions can only be used from Lua.

>lua
    strategy = {
        -- Use global strategy by default
        [''] = 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.global',
        -- Use local for HTML
        html = 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.local',
        -- Pick the strategy for LaTeX dynamically based on the buffer size
        latex = function(bufnr)
            -- Disabled for very large files, global strategy for large files,
            -- local strategy otherwise
            local line_count = vim.api.nvim_buf_line_count(bufnr)
            if line_count > 10000 then
                return nil
            elseif line_count > 1000 then
                return 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.global'
            end
            return 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.local'
        end
    }
<

A strategy is a table which must contain specific fields.  It is possible to
define your own strategy, see |rb-delimiters-custom-strategy|.  The following
strategies are included:

                                               *rb-delimiters.strategy.global*
Global~
"rainbow-delimiters.strategy.global"

The default strategy, highlights the entire buffer.  Has very simple logic.


                                                *rb-delimiters.strategy.local*
Local~
"rainbow-delimiters.strategy.local"

Based on the cursor position highlights only the sub-tree which contains the
cursor.  Updated every time the cursor moves and uses more complex logic than
the global strategy to figure out which nodes exactly to highlight.


                                                 *rb-delimiters.strategy.noop*
No-op~
"rainbow-delimiters.strategy.noop"

A dummy strategy which does nothing.  This is only useful in testing or if you
really want an empty strategy.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUERIES                                                  *rb-delimiters-query*

A query defines what to match.  Every language needs its own custom query.
The query setting is a table where each entry maps a language name to a query
name.  The empty string is the key for the default query.

Each value in the table can be either the name of a query file or a function
which evaluates to the name of a query file.  A function can be used to defer
the decision to a later point in time.

The function has the following signature:

    Parameters: ~
      • {bufnr}  Number of the buffer to highlight

    Return: ~
      The name of the query as a string.


NOTE
Functions can only be used from Lua.

>lua
    query = {
        -- Use parentheses by default
        [''] = 'rainbow-delimiters',
        -- Use blocks for Lua
        lua = 'rainbow-blocks',
        -- Determine the query dynamically
        query = function(bufnr)
            -- Use blocks for read-only buffers like in `:InspectTree`
            local is_nofile = vim.bo[bufnr].buftype == 'nofile'
            return is_nofile and 'rainbow-blocks' or 'rainbow-delimiters'
        end
    }
<
If you wish to define your own custom query or add support for a new language,
consult |rb-delimiters-custom-query| for details.

For every language the query `rainbow-delimiters` is defined, which matches a
reasonable set of parentheses and similar delimiters for each language.  In
addition there are the following extra queries for certain languages:

- `latex`
  - `rainbow-blocks` Matches `\begin` and `\end` instructions
- `lua`
  - `rainbow-blocks` Matches keyword delimiters like like `function` and
    `end`, in addition to parentheses
- `javascript`
  - `rainbow-delimiters-react` Includes React support, set by default for
    Javascript files
  - `rainbow-parens` Only parentheses without React tags
  - `rainbow-tags-react` Only React tags without parentheses
- `query`
  - `rainbow-blocks` Highlight named nodes and identifiers in addition to
    parentheses (useful for |:InspectTree|)
- `tsx`
  - `rainbow-parens` Just Typescript highlighting without React tags
  - `rainbow-tags-react` Only React tags without Typescript highlighting
- `typescript`
  - `rainbow-parens` Just Typescript highlighting without React tags
- `verilog`
  - `rainbow-blocks` Matches keyword delimiters like `begin` and `end`, in
    addition to parentheses


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOGGING                                                *rb-delimiters-logging*

By default only errors are logged.  You can adjust what and how to log by
adjusting the values of the `log` entry in the settings.  For information how
to change settings. see |rb-delimiters-setup|.

The following settings are supported:

`file`
  Path to the log file, default is `rainbow-delimiters.log` in your standard
  log path (see |standard-path|).

`level`
  Only messages equal to or above this value will be logged.  The default is
  to log warnings or above.  See |log_levels| for possible values.

The log file format is a CSV file which uses the `TAB` character (ASCII
`0x09`) as the field separator and a `NL` (ASCII `0x0A`) as the record
separator.

The fields are in this order:

- Time stamp of when the message was logged in ISO 8601 format with time zone
- Log level as string
- Lua module from which the message was logged, or the empty string if outside
  a module
- The logged message



==============================================================================
EXTENDING RAINBOW DELIMITERS

Rainbow delimiters are hackable, you can add your own strategies, queries for
existing languages or even queries for new languages.  Strategies and queries
are split up to be independent and can be mixed arbitrarily, but there are
some rules which need to be followed.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE LIBRARY                                                *rb-delimiters-api*

There is a utility library provided for people writing their own strategies.
It is available as a table under the Lua module `'rainbow-delimiters'`.


                                                        *rb-delimiters.enable*
                                                        *rb_delimiters#enable*
'rainbow-delimiters'.enable({bufnr})
    Re-enable rainbow delimiters for the buffer {bufnr} (or the current buffer
    if {bufnr} is `0`) after it has been disabled.

rainbow_delimiters#enable({bufnr})
    Vim script binding for the above function.


                                                       *rb-delimiters.disable*
                                                       *rb_delimiters#disable*
'rainbow-delimiters'.disable({bufnr})
    Disable rainbow delimiters for the buffer {bufnr} (or the current buffer
    if {bufnr} is `0`).

rainbow_delimiters#disable({bufnr})
    Vim script binding for the above function.


                                                        *rb-delimiters.toggle*
                                                        *rb_delimiters#toggle*
'rainbow-delimiters'.toggle({bufnr})
    Toggle rainbow delimiters for the buffer {bufnr} (or the current buffer
    if {bufnr} is `0`).

rainbow_delimiters#toggle({bufnr})
    Vim script binding for the above function.


                                                    *rb-delimiters.is_enabled*
                                                    *rb_delimiters#is_enabled*
'rainbow-delimiters'.is_enabled({bufnr})
    Check if rainbow delimiters are enabled for the buffer {bufnr} (or the
    current buffer if {bufnr} is `0`).

rainbow_delimiters#is_enabled({bufnr})
    Vim script binding for the above function.


                                                    *rb-delimiters.hlgroup_at*
                                               *rainbow-delimiters#hlgroup_at*
'rainbow-delimiters'.hlgroup_at({nesting_level})
    Gets the name of the highlight group set up at the given nesting level.
    This function will properly roll over, meaning that if there are seven
    highlight groups defined and the {nesting_level} is nine, you will get the
    second highlight group.

rainbow-delimiters#hlgroup_at({nesting_level})
    Vim script binding for the above function.


                                                      *rb-delimiters.strategy*
                                               *g:rainbow_delimiters#strategy*
'rainbow-delimiters'.strategy

    WARNING: This is deprecated, use the string values listed in
    |rb-delimiters-strategy|.

    Table of included strategies.  For more information about strategies see
    |rb-delimiters-strategy|.  The included ones are:

    - `global`   |rb-delimiters.strategy.global|
    - `local`    |rb-delimiters.strategy.local|
    - `noop`     |rb-delimiters.strategy.noop|

    Do not add your own strategies to this table.

g:rainbow_delimiters#strategy
    Vim script dictionary, equivalent of the above table with the same keys.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOM STRATEGIES                              *rb-delimiters-custom-strategy*

A strategy is a table which must contain a certain set of fields.  In
object-oriented terminology we would say that a strategy table must implement
the strategy protocol.
>
    strategy = {
        on_attach = function(bufnr: integer, settings: table),
        on_detach = function(bufnr: integer),
        on_reset  = function(bufnr: integer, settings: table),
    }
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
on_attach({bufnr}, {settings})

This function takes two arguments: the number of the buffer and the table of
settings used by the buffer.  This function is generally used to set up
autocommands or other callbacks for events when the highlighting needs to be
updated.

The settings table contains the following entries:

  - `strategy`   Strategy in use
  - `parser`     Reference to the buffer parser (|treesitter-languagetree|)
  - `lang`       Language of the current parser

A strategy should pick the settings it needs and either cache them in an
internal table, or construct closures (e.g. for callback functions) around
them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
on_detach({bufnr})

This function takes one argument: the number of the buffer.  This function is
generally used to clean up any custom state, autocommands and callbacks set up
in the `on_attach` function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
on_reset({bufnr}, {settings})

Similar to `on_attach` with the same signature, except that this function is
called when the buffer has been reset in some way, for example if the
underlying file has been modified by a code formatter.  Usually the strategy
should highlight the entire buffer from scratch again because we cannot rely
on Tree-sitter to tell us what has changed.

As a rule of thumb, `on_reset` should do the work of `on_attach`, minus all
the initial setup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The logic within the strategy can vary wildly between strategies.  Usually you
will want to install some callback in the `on_attach` function.  That callback
can then use the Tree-sitter API and the utility library (see
|rb-delimiters-api|) to select which nodes to highlight and what highlight
group to apply.

See |rb-delimiters-custom-query| for the standard capture groups used.
Selecting standard capture groups allows your strategy to work with any of the
built-in queries as well as user-specified custom queries.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOM QUERIES                                    *rb-delimiters-custom-query*

A query defines what exactly needs to be highlighted.  Different languages
have different document trees, so you need a separate query for each language.
The queries need to define the following capture groups:

- `@container`
  The entire delimited node.
- `@delimiter`
  Any delimiter you want to highlight in the current `@container`.
- `@_<capture_name>`
  Delimiters starting with `_` (underscore) are ignored for highlighting
  purposes, but you can use them for treesitter predicates like
  `#eq?`, `#any-eq?`, etc. (These are very rarely needed.)

`@container` is mandatory, and at least one `@delimiter` will always be
present as well since `@delimiter` is what is highlighted.  The captures
starting with underscore will be rarely used, since you only need them for
predicates in a few special cases.


Let's look at an example first.  Here is a snippet of HTML code:
>html
    <a href="https://example.com">
        Example<br/>link
    </a>
<

The corresponding document tree including anonymous nodes is as follows:

              (attribute_value)      ; [0,  9] - [0, 28]
              "\""))                 ; [0, 28] - [0, 29]
          ">")                       ; [0, 29] - [0, 30]
        (text)                       ; [1,  4] - [1, 11]
        (element                     ; [1, 11] - [1, 16]
          (self_closing_tag          ; [1, 11] - [1, 16]
            "<"                      ; [1, 11] - [1, 12]
            (tag_name)               ; [1, 12] - [1, 14]
            "/>"))                   ; [1, 14] - [1, 16]
        (text)                       ; [1, 16] - [1, 20]
        (end_tag                     ; [2,  0] - [2,  4]
          "</"                       ; [2,  0] - [2,  2]
          (tag_name)                 ; [2,  2] - [2,  3]
          ">"))                      ; [2,  3] - [2,  4]

As a human I immediately perceive the entire link as one object with two
delimiters: the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag.  Perhaps the
self-closing `<br/>` tag can be seen as an intermediate delimiter because it
does not open a new scope.  On the other hand, it is part of the content of
the entire link, not one of its delimiters.

As you can see, it is up to interpretation as to what exactly constitutes a
delimiter.  In this example for the sake of exhaustiveness we will consider
the `<br/>` tag a delimiter.  The corresponding query is as follows:
>query
    (element
      (start_tag) @delimiter
      (element
        (self_closing_tag) @delimiter)?  ; Optional!
      (end_tag) @delimiter) @container
<
Highlighting the entire tag might be too vibrant though.  What if we want to
highlight only the opening and closing angle brackets?  The query gets
slightly more complex because we have to descend deeper into the document
tree.
>query
    (element
      ((start_tag
          ["<" ">"] @delimiter)
       (element
          (self_closing_tag
            ["<" "/>"] @delimiter))?  ;Optional!
       (end_tag
          "</" @delimiter
          ">" @delimiter))) @container
<

You might now see why we need the `@container` capture group: there is no way
to know in general how deeply the delimiter is nested.  Even for one language
our understanding of what constitutes a delimiter is up for debate.  Therefore
a human must decide for each query which node is the container and which nodes
are the delimiters.  Capturing this information makes it available for use in
strategies.

We are not limited to only one opening and one closing delimiter.  The
included default query captures the angle brackets and the tag name, but not
attributes between the tag name and closing angle bracket.  This strikes a
pleasant middle ground between the two above extremes.
>query
    (element
      (start_tag
        "<" @delimiter
        (tag_name) @delimiter
        ">" @delimiter)
      (end_tag
        "</" @delimiter
        (tag_name) @delimiter
        ">" @delimiter)) @container
<
Here both opening and closing tag have three delimiters each.

In HTML the terminating slash in a self-closing tag is optional.  Instead of
`<br/>` we can write `<br>`.  A naïve query would look like this:
>query
    (element
      (start_tag
        "<" @delimiter
        (tag_name) @delimiter @_tag_name
        ">" @delimiter)) @container
<
However, this query also matches the opening tag of regular tags like `<div>`.
This is where the `@_tag_name` capture comes in.  The set of self-closing tags
is finite, so we can list them explicitly.  This way a regular opening tag
will not match this particular pattern.
>query
    (element
      (start_tag
        "<" @delimiter
        (tag_name) @delimiter @_tag_name
        ">" @delimiter)
      ;; List abridged for brevity
      (#any-of? @_tag_name "br" "hr" "input")) @container
<
We need the `@_tag_name` capture so that it can be used with the `#any-of?`
predicate (|treesitter-predicate-any-of?|), but the capture itself is not used
for highlighting.

ADDING SUPPORT FOR NEW LANGUAGES                   *rb-delimiters-custom-lang*

Supporting a new new language requires creating one or more queries for the
language.  If the query is mature enough please consider upstreaming it so
everyone can benefit.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDING HIGHLIGHT TESTS                          *rb-delimiters-highlight-test*

Whenever you make changes to a query or add support for a new language you
should also add highlighting tests if you want to upsteam your changes.  There
are two steps:

- Add a sample file to show off the highlighting
- Record the state of highlighting

See the `CONTRIBUTING` file of this repository for details.

DISABLE WITHOUT BLACKLISTING

If you wish to disable rainbow delimiters for a language but for whatever
reason you do not want to blacklist this language you can create a custom
query (|rb-delimiters-custom-query|) without any patterns.  Then set the name
of that query as the query for that language (|rb-delimiters-query|).

Or you could name your custom query the same as the default query (by default
`rainbow-delimiters`), then you do not have to change your configuration.
