 Rainbow delimiters for Neovim
###############################

This Neovim plugin provides alternating syntax highlighting (“rainbow
parentheses”) for Neovim, powered by `Tree-sitter`_.  The goal is to have a
hackable plugin which allows for different configuration of queries and
strategies, both globally and per file type.  Users can override and extend the
built-in defaults through their own configuration.

This is a fork of `nvim-ts-rainbow2`_, which was implemented as a module for
`nvim-treessiter`_.  However, since nvim-treesitter has deprecated the module
system I had to create this standalone plugin.


Installation and setup
######################

Installation
============

Install it like any other Neovim plugin; you do not need the Git submodules of
this repository.  They are just used for development and won't cause any harm,
they will just bloat your setup.

You will need a Tree-sitter parser for each language you want to use rainbow
delimiters with.

Setup
=====

No configuration is needed to get started, this plugin has reasonable defaults
which you can override.  Configuration is done by setting entries in the Vim
script dictionary `g:rainbow_delimiters`.  Here is an example configuration:

.. code:: vim

   let g:rainbow_delimiters = {
       \ 'strategy': {
           \ '': 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.global',
           \ 'vim': 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.local'
       \ },
       \ 'query': {
           \ '': 'rainbow-delimiters',
           \ 'lua': 'rainbow-blocks',
       \ },
       \ 'priority': {
           \ '': 110,
           \ 'lua': 210,
       \ },
       \ 'highlight': [
           \ 'RainbowDelimiterRed',
           \ 'RainbowDelimiterYellow',
           \ 'RainbowDelimiterBlue',
           \ 'RainbowDelimiterOrange',
           \ 'RainbowDelimiterGreen',
           \ 'RainbowDelimiterViolet',
           \ 'RainbowDelimiterCyan',
       \ ],
   \ }

The equivalent code in Lua:

.. code:: lua

   ---@type rainbow_delimiters.config
   vim.g.rainbow_delimiters = {
       strategy = {
           [''] = 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.global',
           vim = 'rainbow-delimiters.strategy.local',
       },
       query = {
           [''] = 'rainbow-delimiters',
           lua = 'rainbow-blocks',
       },
       priority = {
           [''] = 110,
           lua = 210,
       },
       highlight = {
           'RainbowDelimiterRed',
           'RainbowDelimiterYellow',
           'RainbowDelimiterBlue',
           'RainbowDelimiterOrange',
           'RainbowDelimiterGreen',
           'RainbowDelimiterViolet',
           'RainbowDelimiterCyan',
       },
   }

Please refer to the `manual`_ for more details.  For those who prefer a `setup`
function there is the module `rainbow-delimiters.setup` that accepts all the
same parameters as `g:rainbow-delimiters`.

.. code:: lua

   require('rainbow-delimiters.setup').setup {
       strategy = {
           -- ...
       },
       query = {
           -- ...
       },
       highlight = {
           -- ...
       },
   }


Help wanted
###########

There are only so many languages which I understand to the point that I can
write queries for them.  If you want support for a new language please consider
contributing code.  See the CONTRIBUTING_ for details.


Status of the plugin
####################

Tree-sitter support in Neovim is still experimental.  This plugin and its API
should be considered stable insofar as breaking changes will only happen if
changes to Neovim necessitates them.

Migrating from nvim-ts-rainbow2
###############################

Rainbow-Delimiters uses different settings than nvim-ts-rainbow2, but
converting the configuration is straight-forward.  The biggest change is where
the settings are stored.

- Settings are stored in the global variable `g:rainbow-delimiters`, which has
  the same keys as the old settings
- The default strategy and query have index `''` (empty string) instead of `1`
- Default highlight groups have the prefix `RainbowDelimiter` instead of
  `TSRainbow`, e.g. `RainbowDelimiterRed` instead of `TSRainbowRed`
- The default query is now called `rainbow-delimiters` instead of
  `rainbow-parens`
- The public Lua module is called `rainbow-delimiters` instead of `ts-rainbow`

The name of the default query is now `rainbow-delimiters` because for some
languages like HTML the notion of "parentheses" does not make any sense.  In
HTML the only meaningful delimiter is the tag.  Hence the generic notion of a
"delimiter".
